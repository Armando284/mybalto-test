## AI Prompt Engineering

The AI prompt combines form data with a structured template:

```text
Create a compelling GoFundMe story for [Pet Name], a [Species] in need of medical care.

Key points to include:
- Medical condition: [Condition] (started [Date])
- Recommended treatment: [Treatment] (cost: $[Amount])
- [Pet Name]'s personality: [Description]
- Family's favorite memory: [Memory]
- How this has impacted the family: [Impact]
- Financial situation: [Hardships]

Structure:
1. Introduce [Pet Name] and their personality
2. Explain the medical situation and treatment needed
3. Share how this has affected the family
4. Clear call-to-action for donations

Tone: Compassionate but not overly sentimental, hopeful, professional yet personal.
```

### Prompt Improvements
1. **Emotional Resonance**: Added specific prompts for emotional connections
2. **Structure**: Enforced clear narrative flow
3. **Tone Control**: Specified desired tone characteristics
4. **Length Guidance**: Suggested paragraph count
5. **Call-to-Action**: Explicit request for donation language

## Example Output

**Generated Story for Max (Golden Retriever):**

"Meet Max, a loving Golden Retriever who has been the heart of our family for 3 years. Max isn't just a pet - he's our son's emotional support companion, helping him navigate the challenges of autism with unwavering patience and affection.

Max has been diagnosed with severe hip dysplasia that requires a $4,500 total hip replacement surgery. Without this procedure, our gentle giant will continue to suffer increasing pain and mobility issues. We first noticed his discomfort last May when he struggled to climb stairs he used to bound up eagerly.

What makes Max special is his intuitive understanding of our family's needs. Our favorite memory is watching him carefully deliver the newspaper each morning, tail wagging with pride at accomplishing his self-assigned task. This medical crisis has forced us to take time off work to care for him, compounding our financial strain from existing medical bills.

We've already spent $1,200 on initial treatments, but as a single-income household, we need help covering the surgery costs. Your generous donation will give Max the pain-free life he deserves and restore his ability to be our son's constant companion. Every contribution, no matter the size, brings us closer to our December 1st fundraising goal."
